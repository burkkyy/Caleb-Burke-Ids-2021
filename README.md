- Two options to get face_recognition:
	1. (ON WINDOWS) Download / install cuda and follow https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html
	2. On linux, run command: pip install face_recognition, otherwise pip installing on windows will cause facial recognition to be STUPID slow (30 seconds inbetween frames on a i7-4510U 2.00GHz)

Other important info:
