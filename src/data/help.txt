How to Create Identities: 
    To create an "identity", simply click "create new identity" on the main

pick webcam, it may take awhile to load for the first time

How to Scan an image:
    To scan an image, simply click "Scan image for identities" and chose 
create from webcam or load image from file. If you choose webcam, it may 
take awhile to load for the first time
